# Ben

A .Net Core project using Entity Framework to create a database schema to show a list of members plus related products they have.

It uses the repo and interface approach and I have seperated the project into core(data) and Web(UI)

To create the DB change the connection string in appsettings.json, the database name is "Benenden"
Once you build and deploy EF will create the DB schema.
